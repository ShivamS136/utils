Every seat has a label which represents the roll number of the student the seat is assigned to. However, the first student has a chance to either take his own seat or otherwise, takes a random seat. Every subsequent student attempts to choose their own seat, but takes a random seat if theirâ€™s is taken. What is the probability that the last student will get his assigned seat?* \n",

The second part says that if the first person choose any seat but first and last, the student who was assigned the seat and chooses either first or last seat would do that with same probabilities. If this student had decided to choose any seat but first and last, then this would not hamper the probability for last person.
